# Restricted Boltzmann Machine: Gibbs Sampling Cycles and Correct Reconstructions

This README discusses the impact of changing the number of Gibbs sampling cycles on the number of correct reconstructions in a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).

## Gibbs Sampling and RBM

Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique used to approximate the equilibrium distribution of visible and hidden states in the RBM. In the context of the RBM, it helps the model learn the underlying data representation and reconstruct input samples.

## Impact of Changing the Number of Gibbs Cycles

Increasing the number of Gibbs cycles allows the model to sample from the RBM's distribution more thoroughly, which can lead to better reconstructions. This improvement happens because the Markov chain reaches a better equilibrium state, allowing the model to learn more about the data distribution. As a result, the reconstructed samples are more accurate, leading to a higher number of correct reconstructions.

However, there's a trade-off involved in choosing the number of Gibbs cycles. More cycles generally lead to better reconstructions, but they also increase the computational complexity and training time of the model. If the number of cycles is too high, the improvement in reconstruction accuracy might not be worth the additional computational cost.

## Balancing Gibbs Cycles and Model Performance

It's essential to find a balance between the number of Gibbs cycles and the model's performance to ensure efficient training and accurate reconstructions. In practice, we can experiment with different numbers of cycles and observe how it impacts the model's performance to find an optimal value for our specific problem.
